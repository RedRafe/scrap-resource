# Scrap Resource

Adds scrap as a new resource to be further processed and downgraded into other products.

Based off [FFF#399 - Trash to Treasure](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-399)

Reverse mods, such as [Reverse Factory](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/reverse-factory), [Janky Quality](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/janky-quality)... are not required but still strongly suggested if you wish to recreate *Factorio 2.0* mechanic.

### Features

Scrap patches are harder to mine than regular ores, but return a more refined product as a result. This version proposes a tweaked version of [FFF#399](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-399), where *Ice* and *Holmium* are replaced by *Crude oil barrel* and *Uranium-238*
